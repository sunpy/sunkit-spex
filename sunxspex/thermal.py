Parameters
----------
energy_edges: `astropy.units.Quantity`
    The edges of the energy bins in a 1D N+1 quantity.

temperature: `astropy.units.Quantity`
    The temperature of the plasma.
    Can be scalar or 1D of any length. If not scalar, the flux for each temperature
    will be calculated. The first dimension of the output flux will correspond
    to temperature.

emission_measure: `astropy.units.Quantity`
    The emission measure of the plasma at each temperature.
    Must be same length as temperature or scalar.

abundance_type: `str` (optional)
    Abundance type to use.  Options are:
        1. cosmic
        2. sun_coronal - default abundance
        3. sun_coronal_ext
        4. sun_hybrid
        5. sun_hybrid_ext
        6. sun_photospheric
        7. mewe_cosmic
        8. mewe_solar
    The values for each abundance type is stored in the global
    variable DEFAULT_ABUNDANCES which is generated by `setup_default_abundances`
    function. To load different default values for each abundance type,
    see the docstring of that function.

relative_abundances: `tuple` of `tuples` of (`int`, `float`) (optional)
    The relative abundances of different elements as a fraction of their
    default abundances defined by abundance_type.
    Each tuple represents the values for a given element.
    The first entry represents the atomic number of the element.
    The second entry represents the axis represents the fraction by which the
    element's default abundance should be scaled.

observer_distance: `astropy.units.Quantity` (Optional)
    The distance between the source and the observer.
    Default=1 AU.

Returns
-------
flux: `astropy.units.Quantity`
    The photon flux as a function of temperature and energy.

def _calculate_abundance_normalized_line_intensities(logT, data_grid, line_logT_bins):
    """
    Calculates normalized line intensities at a given temperature using interpolation.

    Given a 2D array, say of line intensities, as a function of two parameters,
    say energy and log10(temperature), and a log10(temperature) value,
    interpolate the line intensities over the temperature axis and
    extract the intensities as a function of energy at the input temperature.

    Note that strictly speaking the code is agnostic to the physical properties
    of the axes and values in the array. All the matters is that data_grid
    is interpolated over the 2nd axis and the input value also corresponds to
    somewhere along that same axis. That value does not have to exactly correspond to
    the value of a column in the grid. This is accounted for by the interpolation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logT: 1D `numpy.ndarray` of `float`.
        The input value along the 2nd axis at which the line intensities are desired.
        If multiple values given, the calculation is done for each and the
        output array has an extra dimension.

    data_grid: 2D `numpy.ndarray`
        Some property, e.g. line intensity, as function two parameters,
        e.g. energy (0th dimension) and log10(temperature in kelvin) (1st dimension).

    line_logT_bins: 1D `numpy.ndarray`
        The value along the 2nd axis at which the data are required,
        say a value of log10(temperature in kelvin).

    Returns
    -------
    interpolated_data: 1D or 2D `numpy.ndarray`
        The line intensities as a function of energy (1st dimension) at
        each of the input temperatures (0th dimension).
        Note that unlike the input line intensity table, energy here is the 0th axis.

    Split emission between neighboring energy bins such that averaged energy is the line peak.

    Given the peak energies of the lines and a set of the energy bin edges:
    1. Find the bins into which each of the lines belong.
    2. Calculate distance between the line peak energy and the
    center of the bin to which it corresponds as a fraction of the distance between
    the bin center the center of the next closest bin to the line peak energy.
