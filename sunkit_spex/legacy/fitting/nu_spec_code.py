    What's Going On?
    ----------------
    The RMF file has the photon-to-counts conversion information in it.
    The martix has the photon-to-count conversion value for each count channel (columns) that is involved with theach photon channel (rows).
            E.g., matrix = [ [a, b, c, d, e, f, ...] ,
                             [        ...          ] ,
                             [        ...          ] ,
                                      ...             ]
    F_chan is the starting index of contiguous counts channels that are involved with the photon channel.
            E.g., f_chan = [ [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, ...] ,
                             [       ...        ] ,
                             [       ...        ] ,
                                     ...           ]
                            For the first photon channel, there are rows of counts channels starting at index 0 and 5
    N_chan is the corresponding number of counts channels from each index in the f_chan array.
            E.g., n_chan = [ [2, 3, 0, 0, 0, ...] ,
                             [        ...        ] ,
                             [        ...        ] ,
                                      ...           ]
                            Starting at index 0 for the first photon channel we have the first 2 matrix values, then at index 5 we have the next 3.
                            The total of each row is the same as the n_grp_list and the number of entries in each row of the matrix entry.
    Putting all this together, the rmf matrix is:
            rmf_matrix = [ [a, b, 0, 0, 0, c , d , e, 0 , 0 , ...] ,   #<-- index 0 (f_chan) with 2 entries (n_chan) with photon-to-counts conversion (matrix)
                         [                 ...                   ] ,
                         [                 ...                   ] ,
                                           ...                      ]
